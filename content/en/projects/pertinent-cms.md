title: Pertinent CMS
category: web
description: It was with old classmates that we decided to embark on this project to create a lightweight, high-performance and scalable CMS. This project allows me to share my technical knowledge as a developer while continuing to challenge them with complex functionalities. The ultimate goal is to be able to create, without technical knowledge, simple websites with a very high level of customization.
