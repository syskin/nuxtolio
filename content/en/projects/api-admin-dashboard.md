title: API admin dashboard
category: web
description: Following the creation of Nutriwi, new problems appeared concerning the management of the data in my application. Finding no open-source solution that fully met my needs, I decided to set up a data management application through an API that uses classic CRUD methods. Today this application is freely available on Github and allows anyone to contribute to its development. This project also allowed me to dive back into ReactJS by using the typed Javascript, Typescript.
