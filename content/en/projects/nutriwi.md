category: web
description: I created Nutriwi as a result of a personal student project to increase my skills in web development. Nutriwi is now a web application allowing the general public to analyse the nutritional quality of the recipes they make every day with their favourite products. The product scanner allows you to find recipe ideas based on products. I recently signed up Nutriwi to an anti-waste initiative to combat food waste by using products in recipes.
