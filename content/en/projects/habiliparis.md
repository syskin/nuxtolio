description: During my engineering degree, I led a project for the company Joseph Paris (Nantes, FR). We set up a prototype application to answer their problem of managing the authorisations of technicians on production sites. This prototype was implemented with ExpressJS and allows to scan QR codes to identify the authorisations of an employee on site. This application is now used within the company to manage employee authorisations.
