description: Content Linked Data is a SaaS solution for content industrialisation based on structured data. Using the data entered on the web page, you will be able to format, through an infinite number of possibilities, an image that can be reused over and over again using a template system. No more time wasted on generating your content on social networks, one configuration and your images will be generated on the fly using a simple link. After a year of development, feeding and marketing, I made the decision to end my SaaS project of industrializing image generation from a site URL. This innovative project offered users the ability to quickly create structured images using URLs, with advanced templating. In addition, users had the freedom to customise their own templates to create unique images tailored to their needs. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I was unable to clearly identify my target market or generate significant sales. It became apparent that the demand for this type of service was not as strong as I had initially thought. This experience helped me to understand the challenges of marketing and selling in a competitive environment. I also realised the importance of understanding the needs of the customers and adapting the product accordingly.
